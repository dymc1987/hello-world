# hello-world
My first repository for test

This is the first time for me to create a repository in github, and make some changes here.
It is 8:30 PM now, I still in a meeting of my company.
I like coding so much, though I am just a rookie in this area now.
I will enjoy the exciting IT technologies, and make continuous improvement in the rest of my life.

A moment worth to record!
